# IBM HR Analytics – Employee Attrition & Performance

## Project Overview
Employee attrition is a major challenge for organizations. This project analyzes
employee data from IBM HR Analytics to identify key factors influencing attrition
and builds a machine learning model to predict employee turnover.

## Objectives
- Analyze employee demographic and job-related data
- Identify factors contributing to employee attrition
- Visualize attrition patterns
- Build a predictive machine learning model

## Dataset
- IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset
- Records: 1470
- Target Variable: Attrition (Yes / No)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- VS Code

## Analysis Performed
- Attrition rate analysis
- Demographic and job factor analysis
- Salary and satisfaction analysis
- Logistic Regression model for attrition prediction

## Model Performance
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: ~85–88%

## Files in This Repository
- `hr_attrition.ipynb` – Complete EDA and ML model

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how data analytics and machine learning can be used
to understand employee behavior and support HR decision-making.
